├── requests # Main gauge-requests module.
├── stub # A wiremock stubbed api for testing.
│   └── mappings/ # contains all the stubbed mappings.
├── checkstyle.xml
└── pom.xml # parent pom to build the modules.
```

### Stub API

The project uses a stub api for testing the specifications. Bring up the container using `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose -f build/stub.yml up -d
```

The stub api will then be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Running the Tests

The project can be built using any of the standard Maven life-cycles. Jar files can be found in the `target` directory of the module.

```bash
mvn clean # cleans your current environment.
mvn compile # compiles all modules.
mvn test # compiles all source, runs unit tests for all modules.
mvn verify # same as `mvn test` but will also run integration tests from quickstart module.
```

To test a specific module of the project:

```bash
cd requests # change into the module's directory
mvn clean test
```

The __recommended__ option to build the complete project is using docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f build/local.yml up # brings up the stub and gauge containers to build the project.
```
