```

### Stub API

The project uses a stub api for testing the specifications. Bring up the container using `docker-compose`:

```sh
docker-compose -f build/stub.yml up -d
```

The stub api will then be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

## Running the Tests

if you're running the tests locally:

```sh
mvn clean test
```

To test a specific module of the project:

```sh
cd requests
mvn clean test
```

The __recommended__ option to build the complete project is using docker containers:

```sh
docker-compose -f build/local.yml up
```
