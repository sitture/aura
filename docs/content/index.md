## Who should use this library?

* New Gauge users looking to test their API-based applications with clear & concisely described scenarios of http requests.
* Existing Gauge users who are testing the front-end applications with Selenium (or similar) frameworks but would like to just verify the response of webpages without having to implement the step implementations.
